# aquardium_app

# Main features:
Feeding Tab:
 - users can specify how long before each dispenser interval
 - users can determine how much fish feed can be dispensed in the given interval

Temp and Turbidity Tab:
  - users can view temp and turbidity readings
  - users can view records of high readings of both temp and turbidity

Current logic
 - simulated data (random simulation) refer to the following files:
 - feeding_screen.dart
 - temperature_turbidity_screen.dart
 - feeder_provider.dart (main logic of both tabs to help with persistent notifications)

# To be added/considered

  - users can view in the feeding tab the records of the feeding time and amount dispensed
  - notifications for both feed depletion and extreme duration of high records
  - push notifications
